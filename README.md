# üìò Oil Well Reserves Prediction
This project is part of TripleTen's Data Science program and focuses on predicting oil well reserves using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate reserve estimates, support strategic decision-making in the energy sector, and optimize resource allocation.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing oil well data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training regression models and evaluating them using metrics like RMSE and cross-validation.
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to identify the best-performing approach.
- **Business Insights**: Delivering actionable insights to enhance decision-making and risk management.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vyncent-vdW/sprint_eight_supervised_learning.git
